	This repository contains source code used to produce some of the results 
of the SIGGRAPH 2017 paper "A Spherical Cap Preserving Parameterization for 
Spherical Distributions", which is available on my webpage (see my GitHub 
profile).

	I provide the following:
	- The repository opengl_sphere_lighting/ demonstrates a realtime sphere 
lighting technique. Requires OpenGL4.3.
	- The repository mitsuba_phase_function/ provides a phase function for Mistuba.
